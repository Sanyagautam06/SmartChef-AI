## 📌 Project Overview
**SmartChef AI** is an intelligent, user-friendly recipe assistant that generates a complete, easy-to-follow recipe based on ingredients provided by the user. Designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind, SmartChef AI leverages agentic AI logic powered by **IBM Cloud Lite** (Granite or Watson) to deliver personalized cooking suggestions in real time. It’s ideal for beginner cooks, busy students, or anyone looking to make the most of what's in their kitchen — without the need for extra browsing or guesswork.

## 🟥 Problem Statement

Many people face challenges when deciding what to cook, especially when:

- They only have a limited set of ingredients  
- They're unsure how to combine pantry items into a proper meal  
- Recipes online are overwhelming, vague, or use exotic ingredients  
- They want quick decisions without long searches or multiple steps  

🎯 **Goal:** Build a smart, lightweight recipe-generation assistant that:

- Accepts any list of ingredients  
- Returns one practical, complete recipe  
- Uses simple language and beginner-friendly instructions  
- Works instantly with no follow-up questions or browsing  

🛠️ **Constraint:** Must run on **IBM Cloud Lite** and use **Agentic AI** architecture.

## 🟨 Proposed Solution

Introducing **SmartChef AI** – your personal kitchen helper that:

- Instantly generates one complete recipe from given ingredients  
- Assumes vegetarian by default, unless meat/egg/fish is mentioned  
- Uses simple, everyday cooking techniques  
- Follows a strict format:
  - **Recipe Title**
  - **Ingredient List** (with estimated measurements)
  - **3–8 concise steps**

**Example Input:**  
`onion, tomato, rice`

**Example Output:**  
**Recipe: Spicy Tomato Rice**  
(…with full ingredients and instructions)

## 🟩 System Development Approach

**Technology Stack:**

- **IBM Watson Assistant or Granite for NLP & Logic**

**Data Sources:**

- Curated recipe structures  
- Ingredient matching logic  
- Basic substitution logic (for pantry-style inference)

---

## 🟧 Agentic AI Logic & Deployment

**Modular, Intent-Driven AI Flow:**

### 🧠 Core Interaction Model:
- **Input Interpretation** – Parse user ingredients and check for dietary tags  
- **Recipe Matching** – Identify possible recipe formats based on ingredient sets  
- **Dynamic Recipe Generation** – Output one complete, structured recipe  
- **Response Constraints** – No clarification, no multi-recipe options, no explanations  

### 🧩 Agent Behavior:
- Friendly, confident tone  
- Clear formatting (no clutter)  
- Always assumes user wants a usable recipe now  
- Never returns multiple choices or menus  

---

## 🟦 Results

SmartChef AI successfully handles inputs like:

- `Potato, onion, oil`  
- `Egg, bread, cheese`  
- `Rice, tomato, turmeric`  

**Delivers:**  
✅ One full recipe, always  
✅ Simple ingredients, basic techniques  
✅ No follow-up needed  
✅ Mobile-friendly and voice-ready (if integrated)

---

## 🟪 Conclusion

SmartChef AI makes recipe discovery instant and effortless. It reduces time spent browsing recipes, minimizes food waste by using what's on hand, and helps users cook with confidence — all with just one input.
